Offline Creditcard
==================

This extension is intended for stores that need offline creditcard processing.  Orders are automatically authorized after the user submits their payment.  Store owners can then manually process (or use some other automate external process) to actually authorize/capture the credit card.  

Clicking the "capture" link in the admin order listing will also automatically "capture" the order (without any interraction with a gateway.)  This allows for offline capturing (separate from authorizing) if that is desired.
